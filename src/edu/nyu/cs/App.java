   * - you must use the getTicsFromUser() function whenever you need to get the set of tics the user wants to analyze in the text
   * - you must use the countOccurrences() function whenever you want to count the number of occurrences of a given tic within the text
   * - you must use the calculatePercentage() function whenever you want to calculate the percentage of all tics in the text that a given tic consumes
   * - you must use the calculateTicDensity() function to calculate the proportion of all words in the text that are tic words
